# DreamLabs challenge

## Description

The technical challenge for this role consists of a free-form exercise, in which you must
implement an API that allows for invoices to be managed in a backend system. You are
provided with freedom as to how you want to approach the exercise, with the following endpoint
requirements:

- Ability to create or update an invoice in the system, via the API.
- Ability to mark an invoice as being paid or unpaid.
- Ability to generate a storno invoice, from an existing standardised invoice.
- Ability to retrieve and list all invoices in the system.
- Ability to look up an invoice via its number.

Our team will be evaluating a number of factors, mostly with respect to code quality, general
organisation, as well as critical thinking with limited information. We are passionate about our
work, and we are interested in seeing modern, up-to-date approaches. As an applicable mental
model, please consider in your approach, that the target application would likely grow in the
future, both in terms of usage volume, as well as available features.
